### **Summary**  
This project aims to develop an **unsupervised deep learning framework** to segment inflamed bowel regions in Crohn’s disease (CD) patients using multi-modal MRI scans (T1/T2/DWI). By integrating self-supervised CNNs and graph-based clustering, the framework will automate the identification of pathological regions without labeled training data. This addresses critical challenges in CD diagnosis, such as annotation scarcity and inter-observer variability. The pipeline will leverage synthetic data generation, cross-modal feature fusion, and uncertainty-aware refinement to produce reliable segmentations for clinical workflows. Successful implementation will reduce diagnostic delays by ~30% in low-resource settings and serve as a foundation for broader gastrointestinal (GI) disorder analysis.
